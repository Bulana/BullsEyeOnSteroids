We are going to create a Bulls eye game, as you would find from most of the bigginer books but this one, with have four cool features added on the basic game using Swift 4.2 and iOS 12.   

Will start off with the basic boring game, and then think of cool things that it could do and then add them one by one. If a feature doesn't come together, it will not be merge to master which will have the running Bulls Eye App.
