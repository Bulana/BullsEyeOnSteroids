We are going to create a Bulls eye game, as you would find from most of the beginner programming books but this one, with have many cool features gradually added on the basic game using Swift 4.2 and iOS 12.   

Will start off with the basic boring game, and then think of cool things to add. If a feature doesn't come together, it will not be merge to master. Master will have the running Bulls Eye App. Hope this go well.
